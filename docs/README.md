# Odonata
A chess engine written in Rust. 

Odonata is designed by [Andy Watkins](https://github.com/akanalytics) and [Mark Raistrick](https://github.com/raistrma) <br> Bugs in the Rust code will certainly be mine though - Andy ;-)

My lockdown hobby was writing a chess engine, and learning Python and Rust in the process. I started Decemeber 2020. Python and Rust are very different from Java, which I had programmed maybe 10 years previous. Certainly my first efforts at Rust are not very clean, clever or idiomatic, but the code improves as I revisit areas to build improvements.

I would describe Odonata as original code but inspired by other libraries, engines, articles and blogs. There are some utilities code which are more than inspired and hopefully these have been explicitly credited. In particular I use Hoarfrost's magic bitboards for benchmarking (but not movegen), Stockfish wrapper (by zhelyabuzhsky) as a basis for python invocation and JsonRpc (riga) for, well, Json Rpc in the Python interface.

* [Releases](https://github.com/akanalytics/odonata/releases) - download Windows and Linux executables and see chagelogs.

* Odonata is running as a bot on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/odonata-bot). You can challenge her, or see her rankings and games.  <br>
Odonata only plays blitz and bullet games right now, as she's running on my media centre, and Netflix stutters if she's thinking too hard...

* [Compilation](compilation.md) - compile Odonata from source.

* Odonata has a baby [Python](python.md) interface, based on the Stockfish interface by Ilya Zhelyabuzhsky. The interface will sure evolve, and perhaps migrate to a Python extension. Sub-alpha quality, and not actively supported.

## Credits
Thanks to my sons - Freddie, Oscar and Hector - for assistance with graphics, some design ideas and testing the engine play; Gabor Szots and the CCRL team for arranging blitz competitive testing; and the many chess libraries, engines and blogs out there. My apologies if I have not mentioned your project explicitly by name...
