# Odonata
A chess engine written in Rust.

## Background
My lockdown hobby was writing a chess engine, and learning Python and Rust in the process. Currently she's availbale to play as a bot on Lichess. Odonata only plays blitz and bullet games right now, as she's running on my media centre, and Netflix stutters if she's thinking too hard...

I started Decemeber 2020, and Python and Rust were very different from Java, which I had programmed in maybe 10 years previous. Certainly my first efforts at Rust are not very clean, clever or idiomatic, but the code improves as I revist areas to build improvements.

Im aware that this is now yet another chess engine, with yet another set of Python bindings. In part this is because for me, the project was intended as a learning exercise. But if any library owners (either Rust or Python have the time to chat about how I can avoid duplication or rationize things please feel free).   


# Lichess
Odonata is running as a bot on Lichess. You can see her rankings and games here [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/odonata-bot) .
